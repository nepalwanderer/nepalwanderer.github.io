## About me

I exist in exactly two states - "hiking in the Himalayas" or "thinking about hiking in the Himalayas" ;-). I was lucky to spend an entire year trekking across high passes and climbing hills and mountains in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, and Nepal. The mere mention of the word Himalayas sets my mind wandering - revisiting the days spent in the mountains, the surreal beauty witnessed, and the unbounded happiness experienced. My favorite trekking destination is Nepal where I have done the Everest base camp and Everest three pass circuit (on different trips), Annapurna circuit with Tilicho lake, Annapurna south base camp, Manaslu circuit with Tsum valley, Helambu - Gosainkund - Langtang, and Kanchenjunga north and south base camps.
