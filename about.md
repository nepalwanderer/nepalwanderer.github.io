### About Me

I exist in exactly two states - "hiking in the Himalayas" or "thinking about hiking in the Himalayas" ;). I was lucky to spend an entire year trekking across high passes and climbing hills and mountains in Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Ladakh, and Nepal. The mere mention of the word Himalayas sets my mind wandering - revisiting the days spent in the mountains, the surreal beauty witnessed, and the unbounded happiness experienced. My favorite trekking destination is Nepal where I have done the Everest base camp and Everest three pass circuit (on different trips), Annapurna circuit with Tilicho lake, Annapurna south base camp, Manaslu circuit with Tsum valley, Helambu - Gosainkund - Langtang, and Kanchenjunga north and south base camps.

### Philosophy

"I don't underestand what life is all about, so I might as well trek at high altitudes in the Himalayas ;)"

### Top 3

All treks in the Himalayas offer prolific mountain scenary, but if I am forced to come up with top 3 hauntingly beautiful spots..

1. Tilicho Lake - a lake in the Annapurna region, set at an altitude of 4920m.

2. Pang Pema - Kanchenjunga north base camp, located on the lateral moraine of Kanchenjunga glacier, at 5150m.

3. Ngozumpa Tsho - a lake at the base of Cho Oyu in the Everest region, at 5200m.
