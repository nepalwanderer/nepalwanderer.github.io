### Gokyo Ri

Unlike the view from Kalapattar, Everest looked far higher than its neighbours Nuptse, and Lhotse. The view from Gokyo Ri (5360m) is spectacular - the blue lakes on the edge of the massive Ngozumpa glacier which is located in a sea of high mountains, is a treat to watch. Five out of the six highest mountains in the world (Everest, Kanchenjunga, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu) are visible from Gokyo Ri (Kanchenjunga is very distant though).

Once clouds started hovering around the mountains, I started heading back to the cluster of tea houses at Gokyo (4750m). After having lunch, I set out towards the lakes of Gokyo further up the valley. Early November is usually a very good time to trek in the Everest region - the sky is often very clear, with not much snow on the trails. However three days of continuous (unseasonal) snowfall that happened a week before my visit had made the higher altitudes snow bound, closing the Kongma La, and Renjo La. The entire Gokyo valley was snow bound, and even the path towards the lakes up the valley was said to be blocked. I walked in snow for about forty five minutes, and finally reached a small crest on the moraine ridge from where the fourth lake (Thonak Tsho) was visible. The going was getting tough, with waist deep snow at places, so I gave up the idea of reaching the fifth lake, and headed back to Gokyo.

### Lukla, Namche Bazar, and Dingboche

A few days earlier, I had arrived in Lukla (2800m) after a short flight from Kathmandu and started the trek towards the Everest base camp. The walk to Namche Bazar from Lukla passes many Sherpa villages spread across the undulating valley formed by the Dudh Kosi. After an overnight stay at Phakding (2610m), I trekked to Namche Bazar (3420m) a large settlement which is the gateway to the Everest region. After spending a day acclimitizing, visiting the Sherpa villages Khumjung (3780m) and Khunde (3840m) set high above Namche, I trekked to Dingboche (4360m) in a couple of days, with an overnight stay at Debuche.

### Nangkartshang peak

The next day I decided to climb the Nangkartshang peak (5090m) which is the rocky mountain north of Dingboche. There are multiple paths up the mountain, but I chose the steep trail which goes towards the Nangkartshang gompa. After climbing for about 45 minutes, I reached the small gompa which is decorated with prayer flags, and from here there are grand views of the valley overshadowed by the beauty of Ama Dablam. I climbed further up joining the easier main trail. From this point it is a steady ascent all the way to the top of the hill marked by a few cairns and prayer flags. The last section is covered with rocks and was snow bound. The views from the top are fantastic - Ama Dablam looks very close on the southern side, and the Cholatse Tso can be seen far away set in a valley surrounded by massive mountains. I could also see the trail I had taken up-valley to reach Dingboche. As the wind picked up speed, it started getting cold, and I commenced my walk down. It is an easy angled descent all the way, and I slowly walked to the tea house to relax.

My next stop was at Chhukung (4730m), further east of Dingboche. The trail is on the right bank of Imja Khola, through snow covered ridges, with very good views of Ama Dablam, Lhotse, and Island peak. Chhukung was completely snow bound and the prospects of crossing Kongma La didn't look good.

### Chhukung

I started my walk towards the Island peak base camp from Chhukung early in the morning. The trail climbs a few small ridges, and makes a gradual ascent to a wide plateau. The Imja Khola was flowing at a distance, and the entire area was covered with snow. Although the walk from this point on was on a flat terrain it was inexplicably tiring. After an hour and a half of trekking across snow bound pastures, I could see a few colourful tents at the base of the Island peak. The views were amazing - the Island peak dwarfed by Lhotse, the distincty shaped Cho Polu in the horizon, and towards the south east, the near verticle Amphu Lapcha pass. The trail goes near the Imja Tso, a large glacial lake, hidden from view by a moraine ridge. I reached the colourful tents housing trekkers who had camped there planning to climb the Island peak the next day. Although the spot was exceptionally beautiful, it was no place to be in windy conditions. The strong relentless wind blowing over glaciers looked determined to freeze all that it touched. Withstanding the cold, icy winds, I made my way to the warm tea house in Chhukung, after a satisfying side-trip.

The news in Chhukung was that the Kongma La was still blocked because of snow, which meant I had to go back to Dingboche and take the route along the valley to Lobuche. I decided to spend one more day at Chhukung, and climb Chhukung Ri, a 5546m hill accessible by a faint trail that crosses a small stream and goes up the hill. After climbing for an hour or so, I reached a snow covered plateau with great views of Ama Dablam, and the glaciers below. The trail continued up the hill, now mostly on loose rock and scree. Another thirty minutes later I reached the prayer flags at the crest of the hill with sprawling views of the valley and mountains on the other side. The summit of Chhukung Ri could be seen at a distance, but there was no discernible trail, and it was all boulders with thick layer of snow. I chose to take the trail which went to the top of the hill on the west, which was only slightly lower than Chhunkung Ri. The views from the top were exceptional - to the north east the Nuptse - Lhotse wall loomed high above the rest of the mountains, the pyramid shaped Makalu rose on the east, high above the Amphu Lapcha pass and the Island peak, the Imja Tso - a glacial lake was set at the edge of glaciers flowing from the mountain faces, to the south rose Ama Dablam, and to the west I could see the entire Imja valley which I had traversed to reach Chhukung. Soaking in the grand views until it began to get windy, I reluctantly started my descent and reached Chhukung before lunch time.

The following day it was time to leave Chhukung and move towards Lobuche which is on the main Everest base camp trail. I made my way down at a relaxing pace, and reached Dingboche in a couple of hours. From Dingboche I took the trail which runs high above the valley with superb views of Ama Dablam. After crossing a stream, I climbed the terminal moraine of Kumbhu glacier and emerged onto a wide valley with superb views of Pumori (7161m), Lintren (6713m), and Nuptse (7861m). A short walk later, I could see the small settlement of Lobuche (4930m) which was completely covered with snow.

### Gorak Shep

Leaving Lobuche early in the morning, I started walking along the lateral moraine of the Kumbhu glacier towards Gorak Shep (5160m). After a couple of hours of walk on moraine ridges consisting of numerous short ascents and descents, I reached Gorak Shep, a small collection of tea houses by the side of Kumbhu glacier. After securing a place to stay at Gorak Shep, it was time to head to the Everest base camp. The trail went along the right bank of Kumbhu glacier on small ridges filled with rocks and rubble. All along there are superb views of Pumori, Lintren, and other mountains at the head of the valley. The Kumbhu ice fall could be seen falling into the Kumbhu glacier at a distance. After a while the trail dropped off the moraine ridge, and went along the glacier to a small cairn with prayer flags representing the Everest base camp (5340m) - although the tents of Everest expeditions are put up a little further on the glacier. Everest is not visible from the base camp, although the summit (a small part of it) can be seen during the walk to the base camp from Gorakshep. After spending a few minutes at this spot, I started the long walk back, and reached Gorakshep in the evening, just in time to catch the mountains glowing in an orange hue during sunset.

After a restless night at Gorak Shep, I woke up early and headed towards Kalapattar (5545m), an outlier ridge of Pumori, from where there are superb views of Everest. It took just over an hour to reach the boulder filled summit decorated with prayer flags; The last 50m was snow bound and icy. The views from Kalapattar were classic - the south face of Everest rose beyond Nuptse, and the south col which connects Everest and Lhotse could be seen clearly. The Kumbhu icefall could be seen tumbling off the mountains, and joining the Kumbhu glacier on which a few colourful tents looked like little dots. After spending an hour enjoying the spectacular sight, I made my way down to Lobuche, and then to Dzongla hoping that the Cho La would be open. By the time I left Lobuche, the weather turned overcast creating a white-out condition. The trail to Dzongla went around many ridges covered with snow, and the fast moving clouds and mist made the walk surreal. After losing the trail and walking into a side valley, I got back on the correct trail, and reached Dzongla just as day-light was fading.

### Cho La

The morning at Dzongla was very clear, and I got ready to move towards the Cho La. The trail climbs the small hillock near Dzongla and then drops down to a wide valley. The view of Cholatse (6440m) which towers over Dzongla is amazing, as is Ama Dablam perfectly framed at one end of the valley. After crossing a small stream, I climbed a small ridge from where the trail got steeper. A few minutes of steady ascent later I reached a gully filled with large boulders covered with snow. The accumulated snow made it a tough walk over the boulders and after traversing across a rough rocky path, I reached a crest with superb views down the valley. From this crest, the walk is on the Cho La glacier which was covered with snow. It took around 45 minutes to traverse the glacier and reach the prayer flags at Cho La. After enjoying the views from the pass, I started the descent which was icy and treacherous initially. Although the slopes are fairly gentle and wasn't dangerous even if I took a fall, the ice, snow, and scree made the going slow. I was relieved to reach the base of the pass, and the trail crossed numerous ridges before making the final descent to Tagnag. The entire path from the base of the pass to Tagnag was covered in snow making it a very pleasant yet tiring walk. From Tagnag one has to cross the Ngozumpa glacier to reach Gokyo situated on the shores of a large lake called Dudh Pokhari.

### Namche Bazar and Lukla

After hearing about the snow conditions on the Renjo La (a high pass connecting Gokyo and Thame), I decided to take the valley route to Namche Bazar. The descent was fairly easy - I walked along the shore of two more lakes reaching the terminal moraine of the Ngozumpa glacier. From here on, the trail went around many ridges along the right bank of Dudh Kosi, reaching a small settlement called Machhermo (4410m). A few more hours of walking brought me to Dole (4090m) a popular resting spot for people heading up the valley.

![Pumori][12]

<div class="image-caption" > Pumori, Lintren, and other mountains near Gorak Shep </div>

The terrain after Dole became rugged, and the trail went around a couple of icy waterfalls and I could see a massive cliff at a distance. Just as I was wondering how the trail crosses the cliff, steep switchbacks commenced, and a while later I realized that the path goes right up the hill crossing a small pass at Mong La. On the opposite side of the valley, the large settlement of Phortse (said to be the oldest village in Kumbhu) could be seen, situated at the top of a hill. After the unexpected and tiring ascent, it was a fairly easy walk to Sanasa (3600m) where I decided to stay. The next day, I reached Lukla, after a long walk down the same valley which I had climbed up a few days earlier.
