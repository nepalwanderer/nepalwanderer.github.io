### Yamatarin Glacier:

Standing on the terminal moraine of the Yamatarin glacier, I gazed at the desolate landscape dotted with glaciers, ice falls, and menacing rock ridges. A few broken pastures could be seen on either side of the glacier where yaks would frolic in summer. Lapsang La, a high pass which connects Ghunsa with Lapsang (a small pasture near Ramche) could be seen high above, but the lack of an obvious route was a setback to my hopes of attempting the pass. The wind was now ferocious forcing my trek partner Jo and I to start heading down to Ghunsa. The trail went along a moraine ridge for a while before descending into a beautiful forest covered with snow. After an hour of descent we reached the sleepy little town of Ghunsa, just in time for the delicious lunch at the homestay run by a pleasant Tibetan family.

### The trail to Ghunsa:

A little over a week earlier I had met Jo, a Spanish science graduate who had been teaching in a school at Sankhu (a village near Kathmandu, Nepal). He was keen on this trek route after reading a book written by the legendary Polish mountaineer Jerzy Kukuzka where the approach to the Kanchenjunga base camp is described as being an amazing route. After arranging the necessary permits for the trek, we arrived at the bustling town of Taplejung after a two day bus journey from Kathmandu with an overnight stay at Birtamod.

Starting the trek towards the Kanchenjunga north base camp from Taplejung (1820m), we reached Ghunsa (3410m) in five days, stopping for the night at Chirwa, Sekathum, Amjilosa, and Gyabla. All these villages have homestay accomodation for visitors. Jo charmed the folks at the villages by speaking in Nepali language, which he had learnt while working as a teacher. The route to Ghunsa initially follows the valley formed by the Tamur river, across villages surrounded by cardamom fields; Just before Sekathum, Ghunsa Khola joins the Tamur, and from here on we followed the Ghunsa Khola upstream. The Tamur river branches off into another valley where the ancient village of Olangchungola is located.

### Pang Pema - The Kanchenjunga north base camp:

From Ghunsa, the trail made its way up the valley through delighful forests with moss hanging from branches, with occasional views of snow clad mountains. A little while later the path enters the river bed and the trail forks. One trail takes you to the right bank of the Ghunsa Khola over a bridge, and crosses a scary landslide zone full of rocks and scree. There is significant rock fall danger here, but the trail is more likely to be snowless on account of being on the sunny side. The other trail follows the left bank of Ghunsa Khola, crosses a less scary landslide and joins the right bank trail by crossing the river on a log bridge. We crossed the land slide zone cautiously and reached a grassy slope where a few yaks were grazing. Here there are fantastic views of Jannu (7710m), a distinctly shaped mountain with near vertical rock walls. A short walk along grassy ridges brought us to Khambachen (4150m) where there are a handful of summer settlements used for yak grazing. Our accomodation for the night was at a shelter owned by a friendly villager from Ghunsa who had apparently spent the entire winter in Khambachen looking after yaks. I chose to spend the evening walking around Khambachen while Jo went for a walk further up the side valley formed by the Nupchu Khola.

The next day we started the walk towards Lhonak (4790m). The path from Khambachen climbs a small ridge and goes high above the Ghunsa Khola, crossing many hillocks. After about an hour we reached a small pasture from where the mountains in the Kanchenjunga massif came into view. The trail went further climbing and descending the uneven surface of the moraine ridges and culminated at a high point revealing the massive Kanchenjunga glacier. We were standing on the terminal moraine of the glacier, and from here we could see a few huts of Lhonak at a distance. The trail now traversed an exposed gully wall for a while and we reached Lhonak walking on sandy moraine. The snow mountains were much closer now, the Wedge peak towered over the terrain on the other side of the glacier.

After an extremely cold night at Lhonak, it was time to move towards Pang Pema. The walk was on the right bank of the Kanchenjunga glacier, on grassy moraine ridges broken by numerous landslides. The mountain scenary was getting better and better with each step. After a couple of hours, we reached the solitary stone shelter at Pang Pema (5140m). Any attempt to capture the beauty of the place in words or in photographs is painfully futile. The actual north base camp (the location where mountaineers attempting Kanchenjunga place the base camp) is on a glacier, and is of difficult access for trekkers. By climbing the hill right behing the stone shelter, one can get a fairy tale panorama of peaks - the Kanchenjunga, Yalung Kang, Wedge peak, the Twins, and Patibhara Khas, and the icefalls emanating from their jagged ridges which culminate in massive glaciers. As much as we would've loved to camp at Pang Pema, the lack of a tent and food supplies meant we had to head back to Lhonak. The weather deteriorated quickly, with strong icy winds ripping across, and it started snowing lightly. It was a superb walk back to Lhonak in low visibility and snowfall. After spending another night at the freezer called Lhonak, we walked to Ghunsa the next day.

### Ghunsa to Tseram crossing Selele La:

After experiencing the grandeur of the Kanchenjunga massif from the north base camp, it was time to head to the south base camp. Two routes connect Ghunsa with Tseram on the south side. One option is to cross as many as four passes, the heighest of which is the Mirgin La (4645m). Another option is to cross the much more difficult and higher Lapsang La (5160m). Although I had initially planned to attempt Lapsang La, I dropped the idea after looking at the pass from Yamatarin glacier. We left Ghunsa early in the morning with the intention of arriving at Selele camp, situated after the first pass. The trail from Ghunsa climbs towards the hydro electric station, and descends on the other side of the hill to cross a stream on a small wooden bridge. From here on we entered a forest; I initially assumed that the route would take us around the hill, but I was proved completely wrong; The trail started climbing the hill in steep switchbacks, and after a small flat section, the trail again climbed rather steeply, this time in accumulated snow which wouldn't melt on account of the thick forest canopy. After an agonizing climb I reached a small clearing with spectacular views of the entire valley down below. The settlement of Phale with its scattered houses could be seen far below, and the high route to the ancient village of Olangchungola across the Nangpo La (4795m) could be seen high above Phale. The steepness of the trail decreased a little as the route now went around many ridges, high above the valley, but clouds had made their way blocking what would have been great views. Jo raced ahead, and a few more minutes later, I could see the Sele La at a distance, with a little bit of snow near the pass. I slowly made my way up the pass, and descended to the Selele camp set in a boulder field at the base of high mountains.

The next morning the weather was slightly overcast with clouds in the direction that we were headed; But the sunrise lighting up the distant Gaurishankar range of peaks was a treat to watch. We started climbing to the Mirgin La in the cold misty morning; The trail was fairly steep throughout and an hour or so later we were walking in knee deep snow with the prayer flags at Mirgin La visible at a distance. From the pass, there were superb views of Jannu, but the mist and clouds rolled in creating a white out condition. The trail descends a little, and climbs to another pass marked by prayer flags. From here on we moved in complete whiteout with visibility reduced to a few meters. The trail was also tricky to find; One route descends directly to Andha Phedi, while another goes to Tseram crossing the Selele La. After doing a little route finding in poor visibility, we were able to reach Selele La, the final pass before the steep descent to Tseram. Even at Selele La, there are multiple trails, and I used my classic approach of taking the "right" trail ;) The descent was initially on very steep rocky path which ended at Andha Pokhari, a dried up lake. From here on the path was gentle through a forest finally arriving at Tseram.

![Ramche][8]

### Oktang - The Kanchenjunga south base camp:

The walk from Tseram to Ramche crosses a small temporary settlement at Yalung, and then traverses alpine pastures for a while, finally dropping into a flat moraine surrounded by huge mountains, and dominated by Rathong (6682m) at the head of the valley. Just after we reached Ramche, it started snowing which forced us to spend the evening inside the small dining room of the tea house. The snowfall was relentless and I went to sleep hoping for a clear morning. At around 1 a.m. I woke up and went outside to examine the snowfall situation. Sure enough, the snowfall had stopped, there was one feet of snow on the ground, and the sky was spectacularly clear dazzling with starts and the milky way galaxy was visible on a skyline dominated by Rathong. After staring at the vista for a few minutes, I realized my hands were numb exposed to sub-zero temperatures, and I ran inside the tea house to jump into the relative warmth of my sleeping bag.

<div class="image-caption" > The early morning walk to Oktang </div>

The next morning dawned brilliantly with clear deep blue sky. We walked uphill wading in knee deep snow. A little later I could see the Kanchenjunga massif at a distance. After a few small ascents, we reached Oktang situated on the lateral moraine of the magnificant Yalung glacier, marked by prayer flags and a trishul. The actual Kanchenjunga south base camp is further ahead, accessed by traversing the broken moraine ridges. However, most trekkers return from Oktang. The Kanchenjunga looks fairly shapeless from this vantage point, but is massive and dominates the landscape. After soaking in the beauty of the surroundings we walked back to Ramche, and then decided to head down to Tseram, and then to Torontan (2990m). The walk down the valley formed by Simbua Khola, from Tseram to Torontan is through a delightfully beautiful forest. It was a surreal day of trekking, with light snowfall at Tseram adding to the beauty of the landscape. We reached Torontan late in the evening thinking about the range of variation in landscapes that we had seen that day.

<div class="image-caption" > The south side of Kanchenjunga massif </div>

The next day we had to reach Sherpagoan (upper Yamphudin) from Torontan. The trail crosses the Simbua Khola on a suspension bridge, and then ascends steeply to Lamite Bhanjyang (3410m) through a beautiful forest. The last part of the climb was fairly steep, and I was relieved to see Jo waiting for me at the top. We could see a small hut at a distance and assumed that we would be able to have lunch there. The trail skirts aroud a massive landslide which has eroded an entire hill, and our assumption about the availability of food at the small hut was proved right. From this spot, it was a gentle descent onto a small clearing at the top of the hill from where I could see our destination Sherpagoan, and it looked far far away :-) The descent continued on a rough path, and after a while I entered a bamboo forest. From here on, the descent was extremely steep and the trail went all the way down to a broken scary bridge across a small river. Once across the bridge, the trail went across numerous hills with a couple of lonely huts surrounded by fields, and finally reached the pretty village of Sherpagoan.

### Across the hills to Taplejung:

Although the major part of the trek was over, we still had a few days of trekking left to reach Taplejung. The trail from Sherpagoan to Taplejung is classic Nepali flat terrain - typically a steep descent to cross a river cutting across a side valley, followed by steep ascent on the other side. In four days of leisurly walk across pretty villages, and cardamom fields, we reached Taplejung, with overnight stays at Mamankhe, Kande Bhanjyang, and Lali Kharka. As usual, Jo impressed the people we met at these villages by speaking in Nepali - so much so that he was constantly being asked if he would like to settle down in Nepal (with a Nepali girl, of course!). Sadly I got no such offers :(

### Taplejung to Kathmandu:

"Will you let me sit by the window?" Jo asked nicely, giving me no option but to give up my favorite window seat on the bus returing to Kathmandu from Taplejung. A curious Nepali in the bus engaged me in a conversation:

Him:	"Where are you coming from?"

Me:	"Taplejung."

Him:	"Did you go there to visit the Patibhara Devi temple?"

Me:	"No, we trekked from Taplejung to Kanchenjunga north and south base camps."

Him:	"Did you climb the mountain?"

Me:	"No."

Him:	"Why not? You should have tried."

I kept quiet and reflected on the trek - the bone chillingly cold Lhonak, the surreal beauty of Pang Pema, the majestic views of Jannu, the snowfall at Ramche and early morning walk to Oktang, the beautiful villages on the south side, all these will be etched in my mind forever.
