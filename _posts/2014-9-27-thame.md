### Namche Bazar, and Dingboche

As soon as the plane landed in the short take-off and landing airstrip in Lukla, I met with Karan and Ohad who would be my trek partners. We planned to trek the Everest three pass circuit going counter-clockwise from Namche Bazar (3420m), crossing the Kongma La (5535m) to Lobuche, Cho La (5420m) to Gokyo, and finally the Renjo La (5345m) to Thame. I had already been to the [Everest base camp, and Gokyo][13], during my previous visit, and was excited to trek in the Kumbhu region again. We reached Namche Bazar in a couple of days with an overnight stay at Jorsale, walking along the valley formed by Dudh Kosi. Just before reaching Namche Bazar, through a small clearing in the forest, one can see Everest and Lhotse.

We left Namche early in the morning hoping to reach Pangboche (3860m) by late afternoon. The trail from Namche first climbs above the town, and then goes around many ridges with small stupas, and good views of Everest and Lhotse (if the sky is clear). After reaching a small settlement called Sanasa, the trail descends steeply through pine forests, and after crossing the Dudh Kosi on a suspension bridge, it is a steep climb to the monastery at Tengboche (3870m), which is situated on a hill. The trail continues further, descending the hill on the other side, crossing a river, and then finally ascending to the village of Pangboche. The views here are beautiful, with the majestic Ama Dablam dominating the skyline. The next day we continued further, and reached Dingboche in the afternoon (4360m). I went for an acclimitization walk to Nangkartshang gompa, and then on to the Nangkartshang peak (5090m). The weather had now deteriorated with clouds engulfing the entire valley, so I made a fast descent to Dingboche to relax in the tea house.

### Chhukung Ri

The walk to Chhukung (4730m) from Dingboche is on a trail that gradually ascends on the left bank of Imja Khola. Throughout the walk there are superb views of Ama Dablam, Lhotse, Island peak, and Cho Polu (the egg shaped mountain to the right of Island peak when seen from Chhukung). After an hour and a half, I reached Chhukung, which is located at the edge of several glaciers. Karan had already left for Chhukung Ri (5546m), a hill near Chhukung; I kept my backpack at the tea house and after a few minutes of rest, and once Ohad arrived, started walking towards the trail to Chhukung Ri. Seventy minutes of continuous climbing on a fairly steep trail brought me to the edge of the hill side with numerous cairns and a few prayer flags. There are spectacular views (in the Kumbhu region even a linguist will run out of words to describe the prolific mountain scenary) on either side - to the south the majestic Ama Dablam soars into the sky, to the south west Island peak, and Makalu dominate the skyline, to the west the massive Nuptse - Lhotse wall rises far beyond the surrounding terrain, to the north the perfecty shaped Pumori makes its presence felt. The Kongma La, which we planned crossing the next day appeared as a minor notch in the surrounding mountains. From this view point there are two hills that could be climbed. During my last visit, I had climbed the smaller hill (5450m) which has a clear trail all the way to the top. This time however I decided to get to the top of Chhukung Ri (5546m) which looks deceptively simple, but is fairly draining because of the boulders and loose scree that has to be negotiated. I reached the prayer flag marking the summit of Chhukung Ri just as clouds were starting to spoil the views; The Nuptse - Lhotse wall was now tantalizingly close, and I could see the knife edge like ridge connecting to Chhukung peak (5800m, which I hope to climb next time :). By now the weather had deteriorated, with clouds moving in. I carefully descended the rocky sections, and once on solid terrain employed my downhill running technique to reach the wide plateau where Ohad and I had planned to rest a bit. However the strong cold winds didn't appear to relent, and we chose to descend to Chhukung to rest in the comfort of the warm dining room at the tea house. The sunset was especially beautiful, Cho Polu was orange coloured in a sea of white mountains while bright red clouds dazzled at a distance.

### Kongma La

The morning at Chhukung was very clear, with the sun lighting up the near vertical face of Ama Dablam. We set out for Kongma La (5535m), a high pass which connects Chhukung with Lobuche (4930m). The initial part of the trail climbs small hillocks from Chhukung and soon I found myself high above Chhukung with fantastic views of the entire valley. The Nuptse - Lhotse wall dominates the skyline on the east, Makalu rises beyond the icy wilderness filled with glaciers and Ama Dablam stamps its authority on the south side. A few yaks were grazing, oblivious of the intense mountain scenary around them.

![Kongma La][4]

The trail continued making its way up gradually entering the Niyang Khola valley which can be accessed via Bibre as well. After a short steep climb, I found myself at a small serene lake with still waters reflecting the majestic mountains. From here it was a short climb on a rough path to a couple of frozen lakes. It is from this vantage point that I got the first view of Kongma La marked by prayer flags. It is a short steep ascent on rocks and scree from the frozen lakes to the pass. In May the terrain was very dry and not much snow was to be found; However I would assume parts of the trek route near the pass would be slightly tricky to navigate in snow. The views from the pass was excellent despite the clouds rolling in - the scattered shelters in Lobuche was visible far down at the base of a massive ice fall, and the Italian Pyramid - a high altitude research station could be seen situated in a side valley. The long descent from Kongma La first traverses a boulder field, then drops to steep scree, and finally reaches the lateral moraine of the Kumbhu glacier. Crossing the Kumbhu glacier, the surface of which is covered with rocks, debris, and numerous lakes formed by the melting glacier, we reached Lobuche.

![Everest][5]

<div class="image-caption" > The classic view from Kalapattar - Everest, and Nuptse </div>


### Kalapattar

The trail from Lobuche to Gorakshep is on the lateral moraine along the right bank of the Kumbhu glacier. All along the way there are superb views of Nuptse, Pumori, Lintren, and numerous other high mountains. After many short ascents and descents on the moraine, we reached a crest just above Gorakshep, with fantastic views of Pumori, Kalapattar, Kumbhu glacier, and icefall. During my previous visit I had been to the Everest base camp as well as climbed Kalapattar (5545m), so this time I decided to skip the Everest base camp, and climb Kalapattar and go back to Dzongla on the same day. The trail to Kalapattar is short and steep; It took about an hour to reach the summit of Kalapattar, from where there are superb views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Changtse; Even the location of the Everest base camp can be seen (if there are tents) on the Kumbhu glacier, near the terminal point of the Kumbhu icefall. By this time the wind was blowing mercilessly, and it was time to move down. The descent was short, and we walked all the way to Lobuche, had lunch quickly, and started on our way to Dzongla. About 30 minutes from Lobuche, the trail to Dzongla branches from the other trail which goes towards Dingboche. After going around several ridges, a few short ascents and descents later, I could see the tea houses of Dzongla situated at the top of a small hillock, under the mightly Cholatse.

### Cho La and Gokyo

I woke up to a mist filled overcast morning in Dzongla, with Ama Dablam hiding behind the clouds. After a heavy breakfast of fried potatoes we started towards the Cho La (5420m), a high pass which connects Dzongla with Gokyo (4750m). The route from Dzongla climbs a small hillock, then descends to a mostly flat terrain right upto a small stream. Looking back, one gets mesmerising views of Cholatse towering over Dzongla, and Ama Dablam standing guard down the valley. The trail starts climbing after crossing a small stream, and steadily ascends to the base of a rock gully. After climbing the rock gully, I reached a high point from where there are superb views down the valley dominated by Cholatse, dotted by small lakes. From here on, the walk is on a glacier which is usually straight forward to negotiate unless there has been fresh snowfall. After crossing the glacier, I reached the prayer flags marking the Cho La, with a mountain panorama unfolding behind me. After spending nearly an hour at the pass, I started the trecherous descent amidst loose scree smeared with snow. Although it can be quite slippery depending on snow conditions, the path is not dangerous. The trail meandered through hillocks, and a prayer flag at a distance assured me that I was on the right track. After a small ascent to reach the prayer flag, it is a further descent till Tagnag, a small settlement near the lateral moraine of the Ngozumpa glacier.

I had a quick lunch at Tagnag, and continued my way to Gokyo. To reach Gokyo, one has to cross the Ngozumpa glacier; The trail is easy to find if the snow conditions are right; Otherwise one needs to be careful and look for small stone cairns marking the route. Just like the Kumbhu glacier, the surface of the Ngozumpa glacier is filled with rocks, rubble, and numerous lakes have formed due to glacial melt. There are nice views of upper Gokyo valley and Cho Oyu from the Ngozumpa glacier. After crossing the glacier, there is a short steep section traversing the lateral moraine, and onto a crest above Gokyo. From here I could see the tea houses of Gokyo on the shores of Dudh Pokhari. Karan had already reached Gokyo by this time, and decided to head towards Thame the next day, while I wanted to spend a couple of days in Gokyo exploring the upper valley; Ohad was nowhere to be seen, and we assumed that he must have stayed at Tagnag with fellow countrymen.

![Thonak Tsho][7]

<div class="image-caption" > Thonak Tsho </div>


On my previous visit to Gokyo, I had climbed the Gokyo Ri (5360m) - a hill from which there are amazing views of Everest, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, and Makalu. I had also visited the fourth lake Thonak Tsho, beyond which the route was closed due to snow. This time however the snowless trails meant that I could hike till the sixth lake Ngozumpa Tsho (at 5200m). The next day I set out in the morning, up the Gokyo valley in search of the sixth lake. The trail is along the lateral moraine of the Ngozumpa glacier, with numerous ascents and descents along the moraine ridges. I passed the forth lake, Thonak Tsho which is situated at the base of a massive mountain informally known as Icy fingers, the top of which is comprised of a number of rock structures resembling fingers. The views were spectacular, the Ngozumpa glacier is joined by the Gyubanar glacier which is ringed by many mountains, and the south face of Everest dominates the skyline. The trail from the fourth lake went across a gully wall, and a little while later I was at the fifth lake situated at the base of Knobby view, a rocky hill. From here I could see the confluence of Lungsampa and Ngozumpa glaciers, and was unsure of the direction of the trail. Near the terminal moraine of the Lungsampa glacier, I could see a faint trail taking a sharp left turn, and climbing several small hillocks. I wondered if I am on the right track, but continued walking further; All of a sudden there were no more ridges to climb, and I was standing on a crest with a large partially frozen lake in front of me. Situated at the base of the mighty Cho Oyu, flanked my the moraine ridges of Lungsampa glacier, the Ngozumpa Tsho was more beautiful than I had imagined. A pyramid shaped mountain which could compete with the beauty of Ama Dablam, provided a perfect background. I slowly walked to the lake shore taking in the supreme beauty of the place. There were many smaller lakes and a small stone structure at a distance, presumably the Cho Oyu base camp. After spending an hour or so at the lake it was time to go back to Gokyo, which was a long distance away (about 10 km). I reluctantly started my long walk back, enjoying the surreal natural beauty in grand isolation. When I passed the Thonak Tsho, I was intrigued by the "Icy fingers", and decided to attempt it next day :).

![Renjo La][8]

<div class="image-caption" > Angladumba Tsho from Renjo La </div>


After the tiring excursion to the sixth lake the day before, I was ready to attempt climbing Icy fingers. Although the true summit of the mountain is out of reach without technical rock climbing skills and equipment, it is worthwile climbing upto the rocks. I reached Thonak Tsho in no time, and started on my way up the mountain. I could spot a few yaks grazing at a distance, near the pastures lined along the north shore of the lake. The climb was relatively easy, and after a while I reached a wide plateau high above the lake, and from there the views of the entire valley was a highlight of my trip. The Thonak Tsho glittered in a bluish green colour, flanked by snow peaks on the western shore, bounded by the Ngozumpa glacier on the eastern side. Pyramid shaped mountains lined up along the Gyubanar glacier, and at a distance the south face of Everest was witness to the exemplary mountain scenary. Recovering from the onslaught of the immense beauty of the surroundings, I walked further and reached the base of the rock structure. The fingers which looked little from Thonak Tsho, were actually huge features - I climbed as many rocks as I could and finally reached a stage where progress was impossible without rock climbing skills. I sat down on a rock soaking in the spectacular views, listening to the eerie sound of the wind, appreciating the desolate mountain landscape. The clouds rolled in slowly obscuring the mountains, which I took as a signal to start moving down. The descent was rather straight forward, and I employed my downhill running skills as much as possible, arriving in Gokyo well before tea time in the evening.

### Renjo La and Thame

Meanwhile Ohad had arrived at Gokyo and it was time to move towards Thame crossing the Renjo La (5345m). The trail goes around the Dudh Pokhari, reaches high above the western shore of the lake and makes a steep ascent on switchbacks up a rocky ridge. We climbed further along the trail which went around a few more ridges before making the final ascent to the pass. There wasn't much snow on the trail, and it was an easy climb all the way to the prayer flags marking the pass. By this time I was used to the awe-inspiring views in the Kumbhu region - Everest looked intimidating rising high above the surrounding terrain, Nuptse and Lhotse trying to match Everest, the distant pyramid shaped Makalu, the massive Ngozumpa glacier, and the cluster of tea houses in Gokyo situated on the eastern shore of Dudh Pokhari. On the other side of the pass I could see a large blue coloured lake (Angladumba Tsho) set at the bottom of rocky hills. The trail descended steeply on stone steps cut into rocks and we reached the lake after a few minutes. From the lake the pass appeared to be set in the middle of unstable rocky hills with crumbling slopes. The descent became gradual as the valley widened, and we walked at a leisurely pace enjoying the cool breeze. An hour later the valley plunged into the main valley formed by the Bhote Kosi and after going further down on the hill side we reached Lungden (4350m). Now we were walking on the left bank of Bhote Kosi on a hill side high above the river, with beautiful views - the overcast weather conditions and mist made the walk surreal. we reached Marlung (4200m), where the trail descends and crosses the river to get to the right bank. From here on it was an extremely pleasant, gradual downhill walk across remote, but pretty Sherpa villages dotted with aesthetically built houses, neat mani walls, and chortens. After reaching a big nicely painted stupa at the entrance of the village Thame Teng, a short ascent took us to the side valley in which the charming settlement of Thame is located. I must say that most Sherpa villages are an absolute treat to the eyes - the houses are always neatly built with great aesthetic sense, and the villages are often very well maintained. The rest of the evening was spent relaxing in the dining room of the tea house, and I was also able to catch the sunset creating orange hues on snow mountains that surround Thame.

### Back to Namche Bazar, and Lukla

We woke up early the next morning and was rewarded with a beautiful sunrise in Thame. After a morning walk to the gompa which as usual is wedged into a cliff, it was time to move towards Namche Bazar. Leaving behind the beautiful and calm atmosphere of Thame, the trail made a short descent followed by a short ascent and continued on the left bank of Bhote Kosi. There were small pretty Sherpa villages enroute, lined with neatly built houses. A while later we reached the relatively larger village of Thamo, where the gompa looked particularly attractive. The trail continued winding its way across numerous hillocks, finally arriving at a pine forest. A little later we reached a crest with a panoramic view of Namche Bazar - which was a short descent away.

After resting at Namche Bazar, the plan for the next day was to reach Lukla as early as possible. we woke up early, and hit the trail which is mostly downhill till Jorsale. Beyond Jorsale, the route is across many small Sherpa villages, with small ascents, descents, and long suspension bridges. A final short ascent on stone steps brought us to the entrance of Lukla, and my second visit to the Kumbhu region had concluded.
