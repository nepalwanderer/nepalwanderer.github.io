### Stok Kangri

After nearly four hours of continuous ascent I had reached the summit of Stok Kangri (6153m) at half past five in the morning. My hopes of witnessing a brilliant sunrise was ruined by the clouds all around the mountain. I waited patiently in sub-zero temperatures for the clouds to clear at least momentarily. It was intensly cold at the top, and the water I was carrying was completely frozen. The clouds relented a little and I could see Kang Yatse (6400m) far away, and the green patch along the faint Indus river surrounded by barren mountains. Leh was visible far away as a large green oasis, in the middle of hills devoid of vegetation. The most stunning sight was that of the solitary house in a small village called Yurutse far below. I had stayed at Yurutse during the Markha valley trek, and the lady in the homestay had told me that from her house, on a clear day, it is possible to see people climbing Stok Kangri. So, I waved in that direction, just in case :). The weather appeared to change rapidly, mist engulfed the summit creating a white-out condition, and I decided to move down. After carefully negotiating steep loose rocks at places, I reached the shoulder of the mountain where the trail splits. I had climbed up on the route which was less steeper; On the descent I chose the steeper path which was full of loose rocks. After my rapid downhill running technique resulted in a couple of falls, I decided to carefully walk down without dislodging more rocks. An hour later I was at the small glacier crossing once again.

Three days ago, from Leh, I had taken a bus to Stok, and walked to the Stok Kangri base camp (4980m) in a couple of days. (I was already well acclimitized having trekked the Markha valley, Lamayuru - Padum, and Tso Moriri - Rumtse trails; A slower ascent rate is recommended otherwise.) Most people start from the base camp in the middle of the night, hoping to reach the summit just in time for sunrise. However, if I were to do it again, I would start in the afternoon planning to reach the summit for sunset avoiding the cold and uncomfortable night start. One more reason given for a night start is that the small glacier crossing is easier - however I doubt if it is any more difficult in daytime. At the time I didn't know better, so just like the other trekkers I woke up at half past one in the night and hit the trail. From the base camp, the trail climbs to a small saddle. From the saddle one needs to descend slightly to reach the small glacier, cross it to reach the base of the mountain. I could see a few trekkers with torches crossing the glacier as well as some half way up the mountain. I went across the glacier which was firm underfoot, and after a couple of hours of steady ascent reached the shoulder of the mountain. By now I had passed all the other trekkers, and I kept on moving up. The trail which was clear until now disappeared amidst rocks, but daylight was slowly piercing the darkness, and I could figure out the path. The last half an hour of climb was a little tiring, but finally I could see the prayer flags at the summit just a few meters from me.

### Leh

After taking a brief rest at the Stok Kangri base camp, I decided to get back to Leh on the same day. It would be a long walk back to the village of Stok, traversing the same valley that I had ascended a couple of days ago. With the excitement of breaching the 6000m boundary earlier in the day, I walked at a relaxing pace meeting other trekkers once in a while.

"Stok Kangri, even if made of gold, can't satisfy human desire!" - proclaimed a quote painted on a huge rock adjacent to the trail. After hours of descent I finally reached Stok, just in time to catch the bus to Leh. Once in Leh, I went for a short walk around the town, the sky was clear, and at the distant horizon Stok Kangri was visible. It was surreal to realize that I had seen Leh standing on top of Stok Kangri earlier in the day!
