### Tharepati

The morning was overcast, and the clouds successfully hid the majesty of the mountains around me. The views from Tharepati (3640m) on a clear morning would be amazing. However, on this day the mist decided to rob me of the joy of witnessing what would have been a beautiful sunrise. Cursing the weather I left Tharepati towards Laurebina La (4610m). A few minutes later, the weather cleared, and the pass "appeared" very close. I have done enough treks in the Himalayas to realize how deceptively close the mountains might appear; However I was thoroughly fooled one more time. The trail from Tharepati quickly enters a forest, and crosses numerous ridges making tiring ascents and descents on slippery ledges covered with snow and ice. After crossing a steep ravine, it was a small ascent to Phedi (3740m) where there are a couple of tea houses; I decided to stay here and tackle the pass the next morning. The tea house at Phedi was set on a small flat area on a steep ridge of a hill, and there were superb views of the entire valley and distant villages down below. Tharepati could be seen set on top of a hill far away. Soon the entire valley was covered with mist reducing visibility to a few meters and at the comfort of the dining room in the tea house I reflected on the trek so far.

I arrived at Kathmandu from Taplejung completing the [Kanchenjunga north and south base camps trek][12], and the very next day took a bus to Sundarijal (1350m) located just outside Kathmandu. My idea was to trek from Sundarijal to the holy lake of Gosainkund (4400m), and continue to the Langtang valley. From Sundarijal it was a four hour uphill walk to Chisopani (2140m) across the Shivapuri national park, and from there I reached Tharepati in a couple of days with overnight stay at Khutumsang (2450m). At Khutumsang, there is a check-post of the Langtang National Park, where permits are issued. The park ranger was very friendly, though was a little surprised that I was trekking by myself. He was very knowledgeable, and gave me a lot of information about the Langtang National Park, as well as other national parks and conservation areas in Nepal. 

From Tharepathi, one can either continue the trek further into the Helambu region, or cross over to Langtang via the Laurebina La. Although there are fantastic views of snow mountains from Chisopani onwards, clouds and mist had conspired to deny me of the mountain scenary.

The next day at Phedi, I woke up hoping for a clear morning, but it was not to be. Mist and clouds filled the valley and despite the poor visibility I decided to head for the pass. The trail was fairly clear and it was a continuous ascent on grassy hills to begin with and snow covered rocky terrain as I gained altitude. After a couple of hours, I reached a snow field and the pass was visible at a distance. I was now above the clouds, and the sky was crystal clear from this point onwards. I made my way up the snow field, crossed a small boulder field and reached the prayer flags marking the Laurebina La. The views from the pass was pretty strange to say the least - towards Phedi it was all thick clouds, but in the direction of Gosainkund, the sky was absolutely spotlessly clear, with the distant mountains of the Langtang range providing a perfect backdrop. I started on my way down, and dropped into another snow field at the edge of a large frozen lake called Surya kund. The trail went across ridges and more frozen lakes finally arriving at a crest where I got the first views of the holy lake of Gosainkund. The large lake was completely frozen and set at the base of rocky hills where clouds hovered around, and above the clouds rose the mountains of Langtang range. I slowly made my way down the steep snow slope, and reached the end of the snowline. Half an hour later, walking along the northern shore of the lake, I reached a small temple; A few more minutes of walking led me to the cluster of tea houses set above the lake, and it was time for much needed rest.

### From Gosainkund to the Langtang valley

Waking up to a very clear morning at Gosainkund, I lazily got ready to move down to Thulo Syabru (2260m). The trail went steadily downhill passing Bhairav kund (also frozen) and another half-frozen lake. A few short ascents and descents later I reached a small temple on the top of a hill from where there were superb views of mountains in the Langtang range. From here on it was a sharp descent all the way to Sing Gompa (3330m), part of the trail in a beautiful pine forest. In Sing Gompa there is a fork in the trail; The one which sharply descends goes to Dunche; On the other hand, the path to Thulo Syabru maintains altitude for a while going around ridges. After mistakenly taking the path going towards Dunche, I came back to Sing Gompa and found the right trail. It was a beautiful walk in a forest with blooming red rhododendrons. About an hour later, I emerged at the other side of the forest onto a small clearing, and the trail began a sharp descent. After hours of continuous descent I could see the relatively large village of Thulo Syabru, as well as the path I would be taking the next day. Half an hour later, I walked into a small tea house by the side of the stone paved path, and after keeping my backpack in one of the rooms, went for a lazy stroll around the town enjoying the cool breeze of the evening.

The trend of clear mornings continued the next day, and I had a long walk ahead of me. Today I would be joining the main Langtang trail, which meant I could expect to see a lot more trekkers. I made my way out of Thulo Syabru, and the trail dropped to cross the Ghopche Khola. After going around many ridges, the trail descended steeply to join the main Langtang trail just before a small landslide zone. From here, I knew it would be an uphill route all the way to Thangshyap (3200m) which was my destination for the day. After a couple of hours of gradual but continuous ascent through a forest, the trail crossed to the right bank of the Langtang river. A steep uphill section later, I reached Chagtang, where there a bunch of tea houses. After having lunch here I continued my walk and the trail went through a beautiful forest and after a while the path went along the riverside. About half an hour later, I emerged out of the forest into a settlement known as Ghora Tabela, from where the sub-alpine terrain began. A little ahead of Ghora Tabela, the valley widened and I walked along the alpine pastures engulfed in a layer of mist. Another half an hour and a short ascent later, I finally reached Thangshyap which is a very pleasant place to stay. I walked into a tea house run by an affable Tibetan family, just minutes before it started raining with thunderstorms.

From Thangshyap it was an easy uphill walk along the right bank of the Langtang river to the large village of Langtang (3430m). Walking further ahead, the views were getting better with each step, and I could see Tsergo Ri, Ganchempo, and other mountains up ahead. A couple of hours of steady ascent, initially across alpine pastures, and later along small moraine ridges, brought me to Kyanjin Gompa (3860m), the last place in the Langtang valley which has tea houses. I spent the rest of the day relaxing and walking around Kyanjin Gompa exploring the Lirung valley, and was back at the tea house just as the mountains were shining in an orange hue on sunset.

### Kyanjin Ri, Langshisha Kharka, and Tsergo Ri

Kyanjin Gompa is a small settlement on the right bank of the Langtang river, at the base of soaring mountains. One can either relax here or do short day trips further up the Langtang valley. I decided to climb Kyanjin Ri (4600m) which is a small peak near Kyanjin Gompa. There are a couple of trails one can take - the easier is to climb along a narrow gully; The other trail climbs the peak on a much steeper path. It took about an hour to reach the prayer flags marking the summit of Kyanjin Ri. The views from here are fantastic - on one side the massive Langtang Lirung dominates the skyline with the Lirung glacier tumbling off its ridges; On the other side we can see the mountains on either side of Ganja La, a high pass connecting Langtang with Helambu. From Kyanjin Ri, I could see a faint trail up the conical shaped Tsergo Ri (4984m), which would be my next assignment :). After spending an hour at the summit of Kyanjin Ri soaking in the mesmerizing views, I ran downhill all the way to Kyanjin Gompa.

The next day I woke up early and decided to go further up the valley till Langshisha Kharka (4100m) - a pasture used to graze yaks in summer. The trail from Kyanjin Gompa went around several ridges, crossing a small side stream which was icy in the morning, and onto the river bed covered with sand. There are many small pastures on the way, with the trail gradually ascending or going around ridges, on the right bank of the Langtang river. I could see pastures and temporary yak herder's shelters on the left bank of the river as well. As I gained elevation gradually, the peaks at the head of the Langtang valley came into view. I reached a wide pasture with a few yaks grazing which gave me an inquistive look, and further there was a small but ferocious stream to cross on an unreliable log bridge. The trail finally ascended to a small crest with prayer flags and here there were amazing views of the head of the valley - I could see the Langtang river disappearing into the Langtang glacier which inturn was emanating from a cirque of 7000+m mountains. Outside the cirque was Shishapangma (also known as Gosainthan), the only 8000+m mountain which lies completely in Tibet. From this high point, the trail dropped to a cluster of stone structures and a pasture known as Langshisha Kharka. I would have loved to camp there and explore the valley further, but since I didn't have a tent, I had to return to Kyanjin Gompa. After saying a quick good bye to the happy yaks grazing in Langshisha Kharkha, I walked all the way back to Kyanjun Gompa negotiating the small but ferocious stream one more time.

After Kyanjin Ri, and Langshisha Kharkha, I was ready for Tsergo Ri. I followed the same trail which goes towards Langshisha Kharka until I reached the base of the mountain, where a small trail went up the mountain in steep switchbacks. I could see a couple of trekkers higher up the mountain moving slowly. I followed the clear trail which went in a zig zag fashion straight up the mountain gaining altitude very quickly. After a relentless
climb I reached a small flat area with a few broken roofless stone shelters, where trekkers I earlier saw were resting. I could see the summit of Tsergo Ri decorated with prayer flags, about 250m above. I made an error in route finding at this point; The easier route goes around a few rocky ridges on slightly slippery scree, and reaches the base of the snow bound summit pyramid; The more challenging route goes straight up the mountain face cutting across a snow slope finally joining the easier trail. Not realizing the existance of the easier route, I took the trail which cuts across a snow slope - the snow slope was easy angled in the beginning, but became dangerous and exposed quickly; However descending the slope was far trickier than ascending it, so I kept climbing, a little scared at times, and finally reached a small plateau. It took another fifteen minutes of climbing on ice and snow deposited on boulders to access the summit. The views from the top were breathtaking - the tea houses of Kyanjin Gompa could be seen far below (1100+m altitude difference), the Langtang river flowing in a narrow valley flanked by massive mountains on either side, the Langtang Lirung asserting its dominance over the surrounding landscape, the fluted ridges of Ganchempo, and the distant but high Dorje Lhakpa towering over the snow bound wilderness around it.

After playing around in the snow for some time, the wind picked up and I could feel the temperatures dropping. It was time to descend; I could now spot the easier trail, but the first fifteen minutes of descent was a slog on melting snow and ice on steep slopes. Once out of the snowline, it was a much easier, relaxing, yet steep descent all the way to Kyanjin Gompa.

### The descent to Syarbubesi

After spending four days in Kyanjin Gompa, it was time to head down. After a brisk non-stop walk of seven hours along the ever changing landscape of the Langtang valley, I reached Syarbubesi. The next day I got a bus to Kathmandu, and during the journey I was already thinking about my next trek while being captivated by the mountain landscape witnessed from my window seat.
