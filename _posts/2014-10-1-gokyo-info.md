##### Trekking season

The best (and also the most crowded) time to trek is from mid October to November. During this time, the sky is usually very clear, and precipitation is very low. The next best season is from April to mid May, during which sky is fairly clear (but hazy at low altitudes). In April and May, the temperatures are warmer than in October and November.

It is also possible to trek in December and January; Sky is expected to be crystal clear with very low precipitation, but one should be prepared for very cold conditions. At least one tea house will be open at most places. Snow conditions will dictate whether the high passes will be open or not.

##### Routes

1. Everest base camp: Lukla - Namche Bazar - Dingboche - Lobuche - Gorakshep - Everest base camp and back to Namche Bazar - Lukla.
2. Gokyo valley: Lukla - Namche Bazar - Dole - Machhermo - Gokyo and back to Namche Bazar - Lukla.
3. Everest three pass circuit: Lukla - Namche Bazar - Dingboche - Chhukung - Kongma La - Lobuche - Gorakshep - Dzongla - Cho La - Gokyo - Renjo La - Thame - Namche Bazar - Lukla.

##### View points and day hikes

1. Dingboche  - Nangkartshang peak (5090m) and lakes at the base of Ama Dablam.
2. Chhukung   - Island peak base camp (~5000m), Chhukung Ri (5546m), Chhukung peak (~5800m)
3. Gorakshep  - Kalapattar (5545m)
4. Gokyo      - Gokyo Ri (5360m), Icy Fingers (peak near Thonak Tsho ~5350m), Knobby view (~5550m), Ngozumpa Tsho (~5200m)
5. Thame      - Sumdur peak

##### Lukla to Phakding (or Monjo or Jorsale)
It is a short day from Lukla (2800m) to Phakding (2610m) or Monjo or Jorsale (2830m). One can even reach Namche Bazar (3420m) in a long day from Lukla.

##### To Namche Bazar
A fairly short day involving a stiff ascent to Namche Bazar. During the climb, if the sky is clear, Everest can be seen from a small clearing in the forest. At Namche Bazar, spend a day rest day for acclimitization during which one can trek to the Sherpa villages of Khumjung (3780m) and Khunde (3840m).

##### Namche Bazar to Tengboche (or Pangboche)
A long day which involves a steep climb to Tengboche (3870m); One can also continue to Pangboche (3860m) or stay at Debuche, reached after a short descent from Tengboche.

##### To Dingboche (or Pheriche)
It is a gradual ascent from Pangboche to Dingboche (4360m). A rest day here is recommended during which you could hike to the lake at the base of Ama Dablam or the Nangkartshang gompa and peak.

##### Dingboche to Chhukung
From Dingboche, it is a short walk to Chhukung (4730m). A walk to the Island peak base camp or Chhukung Ri could be done on the same day.

##### Chhukung to Lobuche crossing the Kongma La
It will be a long day to cross the Kongma La (5535m) to reach Lobuche (4930m), especially if there is snow on the trail. If the pass is closed, take the valley route to Lobuche (go back to Dingboche and take the high trail above the valley to Lobuche). After descending from the Kongma La, one has to cross the Khumbu glacier (look for cairns marking the current route) to get to Lobuche.

##### Lobuche to Gorakshep
A short walk from Lobuche brings you to Gorakshep (5160m). After ensuring a place to stay, proceed to either Everest base camp (5340m) or Kalapattar (5545m) and get back by evening. In my opinion, sunset view from Kalapattar is better than the views at sunrise.

##### Gorakshep to Dzongla
Dzongla (4830m) is a couple of hours walk from Lobuche. If not going over the Cho La, return to Dingboche from Lobuche.

##### Dzongla to Tagnag (or Gokyo) crossing the Cho La
Start early from Dzongla, cross the Cho La (5420m) and reach Tagnag (4700m). You can continue to Gokyo (4750m) which involves crossing the Ngozumpa glacier.

##### Gokyo
At Gokyo, one can spend a couple of days resting or exploring the upper Gokyo valley, which offers numerous view points and climbing objectives.

##### Gokyo to Thame crossing the Renjo La
It is a long walk to Thame (3750m) from Gokyo crossing the Renjo La (5345m). If the pass is closed, the valley route from Gokyo to Namche Bazar could be covered in one long day.

##### Thame to Namche Bazar (or Phakding or Lukla)
From Thame, it is a relaxing walk to Namche Bazar. You can continue to either Lukla or stay at any of the numerous Sherpa villages between Namche and Lukla. Thame is also a very nice place to stay - one can explore the upper Thame valley or climb the Sumdur peak.

##### Additional challenging routes

1. Lukla - Mera Peak - Amphu Lapcha - Island peak - Chhukung
2. Makalu base camp - Sherpani col - West col - Amphu Lapcha - Chhukung
3. Rolwaling valley - Tashi Lapcha - Thame
